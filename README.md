use 'cd' to move between folders.

## 2. Check the status of the project

- 'git Status:
With *git status* I can see if some changes have happened and if some files are ready to be committed.
It gives me an overview of the project at that specific moment in time.
- 'git log':

## 3. Initializing a git project

if any 'git' commant that we run gives the following ouput:
> fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

it means that we are not inside a git projct.

in such case we can:

1. Make sure that we are not inside a git project.
2. Initialize git

to initialize git run 'git init'
